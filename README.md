🌊 Ground Water Level Prediction – Data-Driven Insights for Sustainable Water Management 💧
As part of my machine learning journey, I worked on a real-world project focused on predicting ground water levels using publicly available water resource data across Indian districts.
📁 Dataset included key features such as:
State & District names
Recharge from rainfall (monsoon & non-monsoon)
Stage of ground water extraction (%)
Annual extractable resource
Natural discharges & recharge from other sources
Net availability for future use
🔍 Project Highlights:
Performed thorough data cleaning and feature engineering to handle inconsistencies and improve model accuracy.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify seasonal and regional water trends.
Built and evaluated multiple regression models to predict ground water levels with strong performance.
Generated actionable insights and gave recommendations on improving water sustainability, particularly in high-risk extraction zones.
This project not only honed my ML skills but also gave me a meaningful perspective on how data science can contribute to environmental and policy planning.
